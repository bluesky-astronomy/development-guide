**Welcome to the Astronomy on Bluesky development team! ðŸŽ‰**

This guide is your starting point for getting up to speed with the project. It provides all the
resources, tools, and information you need to hit the ground running.


## About the Project

**System Architecture:**

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Request Access**: Ensure you have access to the required resources.
   - [ ] Bluesky account
   - [ ] Added to github Astronomy on Bluesky org
   - [ ] Added to Bluesky Devs Discord
2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Follow the [Development Environment Setup](#development-environment-setup) instructions to configure your local machine.
3. **Explore the Codebase**: Start with the [Repository Structure](#repository-structure) section for an overview of the code organization.
4. **Start Your First Task**: [Pick a First Task](https://github.com/orgs/bluesky-astronomy/projects/1) to familiarize yourself with the project and workflow.



## Development Environment Setup

**1. Install the [uv python package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**2. Clone the repository you'd like to work on - either with git:**

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

**or the [GitHub CLI:](https://cli.github.com/)**

```bash
gh repo clone bluesky-astronomy/<repo_name>
```

**3. Navigate into the repo and initialize a virtual environment with uv:**

```bash
uv sync
```

**4. Set up relevant environment variables**

Required environment variables for each project are/will be documented in the readme file of every repository. 

> [!NOTE]  
> To work with a repository that requires setting the `BLUESKY_DATABASE` environment variable, you'll need to download the development copy of the database. Currently, the link lives in a pinned message in the #dev-discussion channel on the development Discord.

## Workflows and Standards

- **Code Style**:
  - For now, recommend following community-supported standards and best practices for each language. For example:
    - Python: [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
    - Python: Usage of Type Hints on variable definition. For example:
      - num_files: int
      - user_name: str
    - Typescript: [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  - Formal guidance for code style coming soon!
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Use the `feature-`, `bugfix-`, `hotfix-`, and `chore-` prefixes for branches.
  - Main branch: `main`.
  - The `main` branch has branch protections on most repositories (see above table.) Commits to main will require approval.
- **Code Reviews**:
  - All code must go through a pull request (PR) process.
  - Assign at least one reviewer.
- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests are required (where possible) for all new features.
  - Run tests locally before submitting a PR.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Coming soon!
