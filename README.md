## Workflows and Standards

- **Code Style**:
  - For now, recommend following community-supported standards and best practices for each language. For example:
    - Python: [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
    - Typescript: [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  - Formal guidance for code style coming soon!
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Use the `feature-`, `bugfix-`, and `hotfix-` prefixes for branches.
  - Main branches: `main`, `develop`.
- **Code Reviews**:
  - All code must go through a pull request (PR) process.
  - Assign at least one reviewer.
- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests are required (where possible) for all new features.
  - Run tests locally before submitting a PR.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Coming soon!
